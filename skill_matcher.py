    Extracts skills from the given text using whole-word / whole-phrase

    Plain substring matching (e.g. `"c" in text`) is unreliable because
    a single-letter skill like "c" would match inside words such as
    "certificate", "science", "excel", "communication", etc. Using
    word-boundary based regex matching avoids these false positives.
