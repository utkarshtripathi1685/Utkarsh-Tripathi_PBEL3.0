## About the Project

This project is an AI-based Resume Screening and Ranking System that analyzes resumes against job descriptions and ranks candidates based on relevance.

## Testing Files

This repository includes 5 sample resumes and 5 sample job descriptions for testing the system. See details below:

- Resumes: `sample_resumes/`
- Job Descriptions: `sample_job_descriptions/`

### Resume–JD Mapping (Test Cases)


This mapping includes both matching and intentionally mismatched cases to verify that the model correctly ranks relevant resumes higher and irrelevant ones lower.
